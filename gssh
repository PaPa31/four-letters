Generate a new ssh keys:
	$ ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "your_email@example.com"

		Note: If you are using a legacy system that doesn't support the Ed25519 algorithm, use:
			$ ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "your_email@example.com"

		[When prompt "Enter a file..." press Enter]
		[When prompt "Enter passphrase...", press Enter]
Start the ssh-agent:
	$ eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"
		[must prompt "Agent pid 5957"]
		
		Depending on your environment, you may need to use a different command. For example, you may need to use root access by running: "sudo -s -H" before starting the ssh-agent, or you may need to use: "exec ssh-agent bash" or "exec ssh-agent zsh" to run the ssh-agent.

Add your SSH-key private key to the ssh-agent:
	$ ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_ed25519
or (if legacy system):
	$ ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_rsa
		[must prompt "Identity added: /home/papa31/.ssh/id_rsa (visidoor@yandex.ru)"]
Showing ssh pub-key:
	cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
